    - C. Amazon MQ
    - D. AWS Step Functions

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown=\"span\">Answer</summary>
      Correct answer: B
      Explanation: Amazon SQS offers a secure, durable, and available hosted queue that lets you integrate and decouple distributed software systems and components.
    </details>

227. What is the primary difference between Amazon SQS Standard queues and FIFO (First-In, First-Out) queues?
    - A. Standard queues guarantee message order, while FIFO queues provide best-effort ordering.
    - B. FIFO queues guarantee exactly-once processing, while Standard queues guarantee at-least-once delivery and might introduce duplicates.
    - C. Standard queues have higher throughput limits than FIFO queues.
    - D. FIFO queues are cheaper than Standard queues.

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown=\"span\">Answer</summary>
      Correct answer: B, C
      Explanation: FIFO queues are designed to guarantee message order and exactly-once processing but have lower throughput limits compared to Standard queues. Standard queues offer higher throughput and at-least-once delivery but don't guarantee message order.
    </details>

      Correct answer: C, D
      Explanation: SNS topics can deliver messages to various endpoints, including Lambda functions, SQS queues, HTTP/S endpoints, email addresses, and mobile push notifications.
    </details>

230. What is the primary use case for combining SNS and SQS?
    - A. To guarantee message ordering for notifications.
    - B. To fan out a single message published to an SNS topic to multiple SQS queues for parallel, asynchronous processing.
    - C. To provide long-term storage for messages.

    - C. Public subnets use public IP addresses, while private subnets use only private IP addresses.
    - D. Public subnets are less secure than private subnets.

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown=\"span\">Answer</summary>
      Correct answer: B
      Explanation: The key differentiator is routing. A public subnet has a route to an Internet Gateway (IGW), allowing resources within it (with public or Elastic IPs) to communicate directly with the internet. A private subnet does not have a direct route to the IGW.
    </details>

239. Which VPC component allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet?
    - A. NAT Gateway
    - B. Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)

    - C. Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)
    - D. Security Group

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown=\"span\">Answer</summary>
      Correct answer: B
      Explanation: A NAT (Network Address Translation) Gateway (managed service) or a NAT Instance (self-managed on EC2) allows instances in private subnets to connect to the internet or other AWS services, but prevents unsolicited inbound connections from the internet.
    </details>

241. What acts as a virtual firewall at the subnet level in a VPC, controlling inbound and outbound traffic?
    - A. Security Group
    - B. Route Table
    - C. Network Access Control List (NACL)
    - D. Internet Gateway

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown=\"span\">Answer</summary>

    </details>

242. What acts as a virtual firewall at the instance level in a VPC, controlling inbound and outbound traffic?
    - A. Network Access Control List (NACL)
    - B. Route Table
    - C. Security Group
    - D. NAT Gateway

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown=\"span\">Answer</summary>
      Correct answer: C
      Explanation: Security Groups act as a stateful firewall for associated EC2 instances, controlling inbound and outbound traffic based on rules you define. All rules are evaluated.
    </details>

243. What is the key difference between Security Groups and Network ACLs (NACLs)?
    - A. Security Groups operate at the subnet level, NACLs at the instance level.
    - B. Security Groups are stateless, NACLs are stateful.
    - C. Security Groups are stateful (return traffic is automatically allowed), while NACLs are stateless (return traffic must be explicitly allowed by rules).
    - D. Security Groups only control inbound traffic, NACLs control both inbound and outbound.

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown=\"span\">Answer</summary>
      Correct answer: C
      Explanation: Security Groups are stateful; if you allow inbound traffic, the corresponding outbound return traffic is automatically allowed. NACLs are stateless; you must create explicit rules for both inbound and outbound traffic, including return traffic.
    </details>

244. Which AWS service provides a dedicated, private network connection from your on-premises data center to AWS?
    - A. AWS VPN CloudHub
    - B. AWS Direct Connect
    - C. Internet Gateway

    - A. To store messages that failed processing for later analysis.
    - B. To guarantee message ordering.
    - C. To increase queue throughput.
    - D. To send notifications when a queue is empty.

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown=\"span\">Answer</summary>
      Correct answer: A
      Explanation: A DLQ is a queue where other source queues can send messages that couldn't be processed successfully. This isolates problematic messages for debugging without blocking the main queue.
    </details>

256. How can you filter messages sent from an SNS topic so that subscribers only receive a subset of the messages?
    - A. By using SQS visibility timeouts.
    - B. By configuring SNS subscription filter policies.

    - C. Failover Routing
    - D. Multivalue Answer Routing

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown=\"span\">Answer</summary>
      Correct answer: C

    - A. 1 minute
    - B. 15 minutes
    - C. 1 hour
    - D. 12 hours

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown=\"span\">Answer</summary>
