6.  Which AWS advantage refers to the ability of AWS to lower pay-as-you-go prices due to its large scale of operations?
    - A. Increase speed and agility
    - B. Stop guessing capacity

    </details>

21. What does "fault tolerance" primarily address in cloud architecture?
    - A. Reducing application costs.
    - B. Ensuring an application can continue operating even if some components fail.
    - C. Improving application performance.
    - D. Simplifying application deployment.

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown=\"span\">Answer</summary>
